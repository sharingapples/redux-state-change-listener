# redux-state-change-listener
A simple library for redux for listening on changes of a specific part of redux
state tree.

## Purpose
Redux started as a library to be used with React but quickly became an independent
library that has a very good bindings with React. When using redux with something other
than react, the ease provided by `mapStateToProps` are not available and using the
`subscribe` method itself doesn't seem straight forward. This library provides a very
simple binding for listening on changes on the individual items on the redux state tree.

## Installation
With npm
> `npm install --save redux-state-change-listener`

With yarn
> `yarn add redux-state-change-listener`

## Usage
A callback can be registered to be triggered whenever a specific value on
a state tree changes. Consider the following example.

```javascript
const { createStore } = require('redux');
const ReduxStateChangeListener = require('redux-state-change-listener');

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

// Event called back whenever the todos list is changed
onTodosChanged = (todos) => {
  console.log('New set of todos', todos);
}

// Event called back whenever the filter is changed
onFilterChanged = (filter, oldFilter) => {
  console.log(`Todo visibility filter changed from ${oldFilter} to ${filter}`);
}

// Create the state callback manager
const stateCallbackManager = new ReduxStateChangeListener(store);
stateCallbackManager.register(state => state.todos, onTodosChanged);
stateCallbackManager.register(state => state.filter, onFilterChanged);

// Start the manager, after which the callbacks would be called whenever
// the state changes as per the registered event
stateManager.start();
```

By default, when the value changes to null, it is not considered as a change and
the callback is not fired. This could be overriden by passing a third parameter
`ignoreNull` as `false`. Ex:
```javascript
stateCallbackManager.register(state => state.todos, onTodosChanged, false);
```

## Advanced Usage
For some advanced use case, you can even check between different values from the
current state and the previous state. For this to work, the fourth parameter on
`register` call `fireOnTrue` should be `true`. The first parameter in this case
must be a function that returns `true` if the callback needs to be fired. Example:

```javascript
stateCallbackManager.register((state, prev) => (
  (state.filter === 'ALL' || state.filter === 'INCOMPLETE') && state.todos !== prev.todos
), onActiveTodosChanged, true, true);
```
*NOTE: when the `fireOnTrue` flag is set, the callback is called with the current state
and the previous state as the first and second parameters.*
